If your board doesn't boot any more, even after making no changes to the
micro SD card, even after unplugging the USB-C power cable, you may need
to {\bf unplug both} the USB micro-B (used for serial) and USB-C power cables
to get the board to boot again. It's probably because the USB micro-B is
also a power source.
