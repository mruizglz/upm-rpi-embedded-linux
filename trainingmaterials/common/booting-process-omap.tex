    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf ROM Code}: tries to find a valid bootstrap image from
      various storage sources, and load it into SRAM. Size
      limited to \textless 128 KB (SRAM size on AM3358).
      No user interaction possible.
    \item {\bf X-Loader} or {\bf U-Boot SPL}: runs from SRAM. Initializes
      the DRAM, the NAND or MMC controller, and loads the secondary
      bootloader into DRAM and starts it. No user interaction
      possible. File called \code{MLO} ({\em Mmc LOader}).
    \item {\bf U-Boot}: runs from DRAM. Initializes some other hardware
      devices (network, USB, etc.).  Loads the kernel image from
      storage or network to DRAM and starts it. Shell with commands
      provided. File called \code{u-boot.bin} or \code{u-boot.img}.
    \item {\bf Linux Kernel}: runs from DRAM. Takes over the system
      completely (bootloaders no longer exists).
